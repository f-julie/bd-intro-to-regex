# Java RegEx Guided Project

In this project, we'll use RegEx to clean, read, and perform computations against some data that we read from a text file. The text file will include information about a ship's navigation across a body of water, in a pre-defined format.

There is some starter code provided. Take a look and begin implementing each method in accordance with the action described by its method name.

## Description

We will read information from a file containing information about a ship's navigation from Palermo in Sicily, Italy, to the island of Malta. Using regex, weâ€™ll extract
the important information from this file to see how far it traveled. We will learn to use different parts of the Java regex implementation to search and extract 
different kinds of data out of strings. The project will build iteratively, starting from basic regex matching capabilities like digit, word, and whitespace matching, 
and extending to named capture groups to make parsing the data into classes easier.
